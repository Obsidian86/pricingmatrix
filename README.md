# pricingmatrix
A pricing matrix for wholesale customers to use to generate prices for their resale customers

Wholesale customers buy at one price, they sell at a higher price. 

This tool allows them to increase the price of the products, plus add-ons by a percent. 
It's useful to generate quick quotes for their clients.

(The deployed version had an integrated UPS shipping calculator using the UPS API, and pulled the pricing, size and weight data from a database)
(This version has the data in a javascript file)
